## FEATURE

We need to setup authentication to accesss single or multiple aws systems so we can run queries. It will be role based access that will can assume a remote role that is pre-created and will be able to assume the role to run aws api queries. This is will be used for other
agents as well so should be shareable.

## EXAMPLES

[Provide and explain examples that you have in the `docs/examples/` folder]

## DOCUMENTATION

[List out any documentation (web pages, sources for an MCP server like Crawl4AI RAG, etc.) that will need to be referenced during development]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

- Should be simple to configure perhaps requiring simply aws role arn and account id.
